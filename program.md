### Keynote Talks


#### Petter Ögren (Professor, KTH Sweden)

**Title**: **Multi-agent Coordination using Behavior Trees**

**Abstract**: A Behavior Tree (BT) is a hierarchical representation of a control policy that has been shown to be optimally modular. BTs were first used by computer game programmers to provide a convenient way of structuring the AI of so-called non-player characters, and have since gained popularity in robotics and control. Most work so far has been focussed on control of a single entity, but there is a growing interest in using BTs for coordination of larger groups of agents as well. In this talk we will give an overview of how BTs have been used in multi-agent coordination in general, and in particular look at combinations with both model based planners, and different learning approaches.

**Bio**: Petter Ögren was born in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1974. He received the M.S. degree in engineering physics and the Ph.D. degree in applied mathematics from the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden, in 1998 and 2003, respectively. In the fall of 2001, he visited the Mechanical Engineering Department, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ. From 2003 to 2012 he worked as a senior scientist and deputy research director in Autonomous Systems at the Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI). In 2013 he started as an Associate Professor at KTH, and since 2018, he is a Professor at the division of Robotics, Perception and Learning (RPL) at KTH.


#### Pedro U. Lima (Professor, Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal)

**Title**: TBD

**Abstract**: TBD

**Bio**: Pedro U. Lima got his Ph.D. (1994) in Electrical Engineering at RPI, NY, USA. Currently, he is a Professor at Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade de Lisboa, and a researcher of the Institute for Systems and Robotics, where he is the coordinator of the Intelligent Robots and Systems group and Deputy Vice-President for Scientific Affairs. He is the co-author of two books, and member of the Editorial Board of the Elsevier’s Journal of Robotics and Autonomous Systems. His research interests lie in the areas of discrete event models of robot tasks and planning under uncertainty, with applications to networked robot systems. Pedro Lima was a Trustee of the RoboCup Federation (2003-2012), and was the General Chair of RoboCup2004, held in Lisbon. He was President and founding member of the Portuguese Robotics Society, was National Delegate to EU and ESA Space Robotics programs and was awarded a 6-month Chair of Excellence at the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain in 2010. He has also been very active in the promotion of Science and Technology to the society, through the organization of Robotics events in Portugal, including the Portuguese Robotics Open since 2001.


#### Christos Verginis (Assistant Professor, Uppsala Uni., Sweden)

**Title**: **Task and Motion Planning of Articulated Robots with Uncertain Dynamics** 

**Abstract**: Motion and task planning constitutes fundamental problems when it comes to control of autonomous systems. Algorithms often operate at different levels of abstractions, reasoning about high-level task plans as well as collision-free motion control schemes. The problem is significantly complicated when taking into account articulated systems with uncertain dynamics. Articulated systems, such as robotic manipulators, often have to navigate among narrow passages in obstacle-cluttered workspaces. At the same time, such systems usually evolve subject to highly nonlinear dynamics that cannot be accurately modelled, contain a large variety of uncertain dynamic parameters, and suffer from unknown exogenous disturbances. In this talk, I will talk about how we can overcome such issues and develop motion planners that solve the motion-planning problem for articulated systems with uncertain dynamics. I will further elaborate on how we can use such results on task-planning subject to tasks expressed as timed temporal logic specifications. 

**Bio**: Christos Verginis is an assistant Department of Electrical Engineering, Uppsala University, Sweden. He received the MEng degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering and the MSc degree in Automatic Control Systems and Robotics both from National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) in 2013 and 2015, respectively. He received the PhD in Electrical Engineering from KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Stockholm) under the guidance of Prof. Dimos Dimarogonas and Prof. Danica Kragic. His PhD Thesis involved planning and control of multi-robot manipulator-endowed systems. His PhD thesis was awarded the EECI PhD award on Control for Complex and Heterogeneous Systems 2021 and was selected to be one of the finalists for the EuRobotics Georges Giralt PhD award 2021.


### Yulong Gao (Assistant Professor, Imperial College London, UK)

**Title**: **Distribution-based CTL Model Checking and its Application to Multi-Agent Control**

**Abstract**: In this talk, we will discuss the computation tree logic (CTL) model checking for finite-state Markov decision processes (MDPs) over the space of their distributions. Unlike the standard probabilistic CTL (PCTL), we use CTL to specify properties over the space of distributions, which provides an alternative way to express probabilistic requirements and in particular enables to express distinctive semantics. We then propose reachability-based CTL model checking algorithms over distribution spaces, as well as computationally tractable, sampling-based procedures for computing the relevant reachable sets. We finally apply our algroithm to synthesize control strategy to multi-agent swarm system.

**Bio**: Yulong Gao received the B.E. degree in automation and the M.E. degree in control science and engineering from the Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2013 and 2016, respectively, and the joint Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, and Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2021. He was a Visiting Student with the Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, U.K., in 2019. He is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher with KTH. His research interests include automatic verification, stochastic control, and model predictive control with application to safety-critical systems.
